### Key Directories Explained:

- **`app/api/`** - Contains server-side API routes for backend communication
- **`app/components/`** - Core application components organized by feature
- **`app/pages/`** - Main page components (Chat, Data, Settings, etc.)
- **`app/types/`** - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **`components/ui/`** - Reusable UI components built with Radix UI
- **`hooks/`** - Custom React hooks for shared logic
- **`public/`** - Static files like images and icons

## 🎯 Application Features

### Single Page Application (SPA)

Elysia is built as a SPA using Next.js with client-side routing. The main navigation happens through React context (`RouterContext`) without page reloads, providing a smooth user experience.

### Main Sections:

- **Chat** - AI conversation interface
- **Data** - Data exploration and visualization
- **Settings** - Configuration management
- **Evaluation** - AI model evaluation tools
- **Explorer** - Advanced data browsing

### Key Capabilities:

- Real-time chat with AI models
- Interactive data visualizations
- 3D graphics and globe visualizations
- Configurable AI model settings
- Data collection management
- Feedback and evaluation systems

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server

# Building
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run build:clean     # Clean build (removes cache first)

# Export & Assembly
npm run export          # Export static files to backend
npm run assemble        # Build and export in one command
npm run assemble:clean  # Clean build and export

# Other
npm start              # Start production server
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
```

## 🔨 Build Process

The application uses a custom build process designed for static export:

1. **Build**: Creates an optimized production build
2. **Export**: Generates static files in the `out/` directory
3. **Assembly**: Copies exported files to the backend's static directory

The `export.sh` script handles copying the built static files to `../elysia/api/static` for integration with the backend server.

## 🌐 Environment Configuration

The application supports various environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_STATIC` - Enables static export mode

## 🎨 Styling & Theming

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **CSS Custom Properties** for dynamic theming
- **Custom fonts**: Space Grotesk (text) and Manrope (headings)
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Dark mode support** via CSS classes

## 🧩 Architecture Patterns

- **Context-based state management** for global state
- **Component composition** with Radix UI primitives
- **Custom hooks** for shared logic
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Modular component organization** by feature
